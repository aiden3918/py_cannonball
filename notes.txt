if cannon points directly up or down, the whole game freezes (fixed)

to do:
- dynamic barrel length that affects firing in [aiming and config render]*
- fine tune the position when it leaves the barrel (not needed if line 11 is implemented) ** 

future plans:
- add recoil to cannon
- compile to .exe 
- change calculations to include impulse/momentum (maybe not actually)
- ! make the cannonball actually move out of the cannon instead of just calculating the time and pausing [new function during firing app state]

bug checklist:
 - number input does will display when using sliders (ITS A FEATURE!)

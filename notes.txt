if cannon points directly up or down, the whole game freezes (fixed)

to do:
- dynamic barrel length that affects firing in [aiming and config render]* - DONE

- ! make the cannonball actually move out of the cannon instead of just calculating the time and pausing [new function during firing app state] ** - DONE
    - d = vo*t + t^2 * a / 2
    - (x, y) = d * cos(angle.to_rad()), d * sin(angle.to_rad())
    - if d > barrel_length, switch to cannonball arc app state and return the last (x, y) of the cannonball when exiting cannon

- fine tune the position when it leaves the barrel [not needed if smooth initial cannon firing (line 11) is implemented] *** - DONE

- add extra information during cannonball arc (using black font) ****
    - exit velocity
    - time it took to exit cannon
    - acceleration
    - net force
    
    - horizontal force applied
    - net horizontal force

    - vertical force applied
    - weight
    - normal force
    - net vertical force

    HOW TO DO:
    1. cannonball_physics_data[1:3] will each store info on a tuple
    2.  make a text element tuple
    3. traverse the tuple to render and blit all of the elements with corresponding text

- add more info page that describes how the app works and stuff (cannot only be clicked during aiming and config app state, also switch app state on click) *****

future plans:
- add recoil to cannon / change calculations to include impulse/momentum (maybe not actually)
- compile to .exe 

bug checklist:
 - number input does will display when using sliders (ITS A FEATURE!)

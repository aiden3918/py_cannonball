if cannon points directly up or down, the whole game freezes (fixed)

to do:
- dynamic barrel length that affects firing

future plans:
- add recoil to cannon
- compile to .exe 
- change calculations to include impulse/momentum

bug checklist:
 - cannon doesnt fire when shooting straight up, even with enough force
 - number input does will display when using sliders (ITS A FEATURE!)

if cannon points directly up or down, the whole game freezes (fixed)

to do:
- dynamic barrel length that affects firing in [aiming and config render]* - DONE
- ! make the cannonball actually move out of the cannon instead of just calculating the time and pausing [new function during firing app state] **
    - d = vo*t + t^2 * a / 2
    - (x, y) = d * cos(angle.to_rad()), d * sin(angle.to_rad())
    - if d > barrel_length, switch to cannonball arc app state and return the last (x, y) of the cannonball when exiting cannon
- fine tune the position when it leaves the barrel [not needed if smooth initial cannon firing (line 11) is implemented] *** 

future plans:
- add recoil to cannon / change calculations to include impulse/momentum (maybe not actually)
- compile to .exe 

bug checklist:
 - number input does will display when using sliders (ITS A FEATURE!)

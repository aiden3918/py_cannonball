if cannon points directly up or down, the whole game freezes (fixed)

to do:
- replayability *
- path tracing (red dots) DONE
- user input (perhaps make a slider class) force, barrel length, cannonball mass, gravity(?) BASICALLY DONE


bug checklist:
 - cannon doesnt fire when shooting straight up, even with enough force
 - gravity works fine, im just dumb
 - some grid lines dont show, its a pygame problem (FIXED, it was an issue with the scaling transformation)

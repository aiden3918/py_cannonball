if cannon points directly up or down, the whole game freezes (fixed)

to do:
- compile to .exe *
- push to gh **

future plans:
- add recoil to cannon / change calculations to include impulse/momentum (maybe not actually)

bug checklist:
 - number input does not display when using sliders (ITS A FEATURE!)

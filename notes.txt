if cannon points directly up or down, the whole game freezes (fixed)

to do:

- add extra information during cannonball arc (using black font)- DONE
    - exit velocity
    - time it took to exit cannon
    - acceleration
    - net force
    
    - horizontal force applied
    - net horizontal force
    - horizontal normal force

    - vertical force applied
    - vertical weight
    - vertical normal force
    - net vertical force

    HOW TO DO:
    1. cannonball_physics_data[1:3] will each store info on a tuple
    2.  make a text element tuple
    3. traverse the tuple to render and blit all of the elements with corresponding text

- research and verify how normal force works for spherical objects !!! * - DONE?
- add more info page that describes how the app works and stuff (cannot only be clicked during aiming and config app state, also switch app state on click) ** - DONE
- add option to disable perf data and cb exit data *** - DONE

future plans:
- add recoil to cannon / change calculations to include impulse/momentum (maybe not actually)
- compile to .exe 

bug checklist:
 - number input does will display when using sliders (ITS A FEATURE!)

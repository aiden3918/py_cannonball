# Cannonball - A Pygame Project

Specs:
- Python v3.11.4
- Pygame v2.5.0
- Pip v23.1.2
- Compiled with Pyinstaller v5.13.0
- Setuptools v65.5.0

This is an app designed to simulate the forces and kinematics of a cannonball being launched from a cannon, assuming no air resistance and that the coeffcient of friction is 0.

How it works:
1. Adjust the sliders in order to simualte different independent variables.
2. Press [SPACE] in order to launch the cannonball.
3. Track the behavior of the cannonball using graphics and given data.
4. Wait 20 seconds or press [R] to restart.

More features may be added in the future.
